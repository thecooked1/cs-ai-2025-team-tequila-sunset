### 📊 Quick Health Check
```markdown
| Category | Rating (1-5) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Communication** | 4/5 | Great during planning; need to maintain high bandwidth as we start coding separately. |
| **Collaboration** | 5/5 | The architecture and backlog planning sessions were highly collaborative and effective. |
| **Technical Progress** | 3/5 | Feels slow as we are laying foundations, but we are on track with the initial setup tasks. |
| **Workload Balance** | 4/5 | Currently balanced, but we need to be mindful as feature complexity increases. |
| **Morale** | 5/5 | Very high. We're all excited about the plan and ready to build. |
| **Confidence in Success**| 5/5 | The detailed planning gives us high confidence in our ability to deliver the MVP. |
```
**Overall Team Health: 4.3/5**

### ✅ What's Working Well

#### Communication
- Our deep-dive sessions for the architecture doc and backlog were extremely productive.
- Everyone feels comfortable speaking up and challenging ideas respectfully.
- We have a shared understanding of the project vision and the "Walk, Run, Fly" scope.

#### Technical Collaboration
- We successfully agreed on the core technology stack (React, FastAPI) and deployment platforms (Vercel, Render).
- The process of creating the architecture document forced us to align on the API structure early.

#### Task Management
- The prioritized backlog (P1, P2, P3) gives us a very clear roadmap.
- Assigning owners to issues in the backlog provides clear accountability.

### ⚠️ What Needs Improvement

#### Challenge 1: Bridging the Frontend-Backend Gap
**Description:** As the Frontend and Backend leads start building their respective parts in parallel, there's a risk that their implementations will be based on slightly different assumptions about the API contract (e.g., the exact JSON structure of a message).
**Impact:** This could lead to significant and frustrating integration issues in Week 5, causing delays and rework.
**Proposed Solution:** Before any more API-dependent code is written, the Backend lead will create a simple, formal API contract document (using Markdown or a Postman collection). This document will define the exact request/response schemas for the `/api/chat` endpoint. The Frontend lead must review and approve this contract.
**Owner:** [Backend Lead] to create, [Frontend Lead] to approve.
**Target Date:** End of Week 4.

#### Challenge 2: Maintaining Momentum After the Planning Phase
**Description:** We've spent a lot of time on high-level planning. Now, the initial coding tasks (setting up boilerplate, deployments) can feel slow and less rewarding, which can lead to a dip in momentum.
**Impact:** A potential slowdown in velocity at the critical start of the development phase.
**Proposed Solution:** We will implement short, daily stand-up meetings (15 mins max) to check in, share progress (even small wins), and identify blockers. This creates a daily rhythm and makes progress more visible.
**Owner:** All team members to participate.
**Target Date:** Starting Week 5.

### 👥 Individual Check-Ins

#### Team Member 1: [Name]
**Role:** Backend / AI Lead
**Current Tasks:** [Issue #1] Setup Backend with Health Check.
**Capacity This Week:** Comfortable (3/5).
**Blockers:** None currently.
**Support Needed:** Need confirmation from the Frontend lead on the proposed API contract.

#### Team Member 2: [Name]
**Role:** Frontend Lead
**Current Tasks:** [Issue #2] Create Frontend UI Shell.
**Capacity This Week:** Comfortable (3/5).
**Blockers:** I can build the static UI, but will be blocked on the `useChat` hook until the API contract is finalized.
**Support Needed:** The API contract from the Backend lead.

#### Team Member 3: [Name]
**Role:** AI / Visuals Lead
**Current Tasks:** [Issue #4] Researching and drafting the V1 system prompt. Setting up the GitHub Actions CI pipeline for future testing.
**Capacity This Week:** Light (4/5).
**Blockers:** None.
**Support Needed:** Can offer support to either frontend or backend with documentation or setup tasks if needed.

### 🔄 Updated Team Contract (If Changes Needed)

We propose one change to our team contract to address the challenges identified above.

#### Changes from Week 2 Contract
```markdown
| Aspect | Week 2 | Week 4 Update | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Meeting Schedule** | One 60-minute sync per week. | Keep the weekly sync, but add a 15-minute daily stand-up (Mon-Thurs). | To improve communication bandwidth, prevent developer silos, and maintain momentum during the intensive build phase. |
```

### 🚨 Risk Mitigation

#### Team-Level Risks

**Risk 1: Development Silos**
**Description:** Frontend and backend work progresses without sufficient communication, leading to integration failures when we try to connect them.
**Likelihood:** High
**Impact:** Medium
**Mitigation Plan:**
- Implement the formal API contract.
- Hold daily stand-up meetings to ensure constant, low-friction communication.
**Early Warning Signs:** A PR is opened with code that doesn't match the other side's expectations; confusion during weekly syncs about API data structures.
**Escalation Path:** If a disagreement on the contract can't be resolved, the team will schedule a 30-minute deep-dive to resolve it before any more code is written.

### 📈 Progress Tracking

#### Velocity (Tasks Completed per Week)
```markdown
| Week | Planned | Completed | % |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3 | 0 | 0 | N/A |
| 4 | 2 | 0 | 0% |
```
**Trend:** ➡️ Stable (just starting development).

**Insights:**
Our velocity for coding tasks is currently zero, which is expected as Weeks 1-3 were dedicated to planning and documentation. We expect this to ramp up significantly starting now that the foundation is set.

---
### 💪 Team Strengths

**Technical Skills:**
- Strong foundational knowledge in Python/FastAPI and React.
- Proactive in learning and adopting best practices (e.g., streaming, Pydantic).

**Collaboration:**
- Excellent at detailed planning and documentation, creating a very strong shared vision.
- We have built a foundation of psychological safety where team members can voice concerns.

### 🎯 Goals for Next 2 Weeks

#### Team Goals
1.  **Complete the Core Chat Loop (Issue #3):** A user must be able to send a message and get a text response back. This is our top priority.
2.  **Deploy a Fully Integrated System:** Both frontend and backend should be deployed and communicating successfully on their staging URLs.
3.  **Finalize V1 System Prompt (Issue #4):** The AI's persona should be integrated and functional.

#### Individual Goals
**[Member 1 Name]:** Deploy the backend and implement the full `/api/chat` logic.
**[Member 2 Name]:** Connect the frontend to the live backend and manage the full request/response state.
**[Member 3 Name]:** Finalize and test the V1 system prompt; set up the initial CI pipeline.
